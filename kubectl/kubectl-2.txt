1. Rolling Out changes (updating a deployment)
------------------------------------------------
- To apply changes to a deployment (e.g. update an image or configuration)
=> kubectl set image deployment/<deployment-name> <container-name>=<new-image>

- Example:
=> kubectl set image deployment/my-app my-app-container=my-app:v2

- To view the rollout status deployment:
=> kubectl rolling status deployment/<deployment-name>

2. Checking rolling history:
- To see the revision hiostory of the deployment:
=> kubectl rollou history deployment/<deployment-name>

- To view more details about a specific revision:
=> kubectl rollout history deploymemt/<deploymemt-name> --revision=<revision-number>

3. ROlling back changes (Reverting a deploymemt)
- To rollback to the previous version of a deployment:
=> kubectl rollout undo deployment/<deployment-name>

- To rollback to a specific revision:
=> kubectl rollout undo deployment/<deployment-name> --to-revision=<revision-number>

4. Pause and resume a rollout
-To pause a rollout (useful if you want to stop an automatic deployment in the middle)
=> kubectl rollout pause deployment/<deployment-name>

- To resume a paused rollout:
=> kubectl rollout resume deployment/<deployment-name>

5. Verifying Deployment rollout
- You can use the following command to view the details of your deployment and their 
=> kubectl get deployments

6. Scalling the Deployment
- Scalling up or down a deploymentcan also be part of the rollout process:
=> kubectl scale deployment/<deployment-name> --replicas=<number-of-replicas>
